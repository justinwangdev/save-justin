                My career is amazing. It's funny, but I didn't know that until I found out I was going to have to find a new job. That it was going to happen soon. That it was real. Then I thought about a lot of stuff. Things I hadn't thought about for a long time. I guess I kind of took my current position for granted or something. I mean, stable tech jobs are just always there. You expect them to always be giving you interesting problems to solve or systems to optimize or code to refactor to grow up to be a more well-rounded engineer one day. And make you get up early for standups and sprint planning and all that other stuff that used to drive me crazy. I don't feel that way now. Everything's different since I realized the tech industry is volatile. Since I realized that one day in the near future, I might not have a stable backend engineering role serving 10K+ merchants and 10M+ users.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now I feel lucky when a PR gets approved (I used to totally dread code reviews) or when production doesn't go down during my on-call rotation and systems stay reliable. One day I might not have these problems to solve. Now I feel lucky when I see a successful deployment notification. I even like debugging race conditions and digging through Kibana logs at 2 AM hunting down bugs reported by the support team. It means I'm still employed. Still a backend engineer. Still rotating as the on-duty Technical Support Engineer every two months, living the dream.

                I'm a backend engineer at Cyberbiz and I'm annoyingly thorough. I mean, super detail-oriented annoying. I know the most random stuff. Like how to properly scope LINE webhook integrations so shops don't accidentally message each other's customers. And how to design a message center architecture that's expandable for future e-commerce platforms we haven't even thought of yet. Or that when you're dealing with LLM agents calling your MCP endpoints, you have to get real creative with access control because the agent doesn't care about your beautiful authentication middleware. I'm always dropping little facts about Rails performance optimization and multi-tenant database isolation. I don't realize what a geek I am for doing it, I'm just really into backend development. I think I really don't understand that not everybody is. I like sitting in meetings with PMs and UI/UX designers, negotiating what's "engineering doable" versus what makes designers happy. I mostly work on e-commerce features - combo products, merchant tools, stuff like that - and I'm always explaining as I go. I'm told I'm a pretty good engineer. I get a lot of practice, that's for sure. 65+ PRs and counting.

                My career is amazing. It's funny, but I didn't know that until I found out I was going to have to find a new job. That it was going to happen soon. That it was real. Then I thought about a lot of stuff. Things I hadn't thought about for a long time. I guess I kind of took my current position for granted or something. I mean, stable tech jobs are just always there. You expect them to always be giving you interesting problems to solve or systems to optimize or code to refactor to grow up to be a more well-rounded engineer one day. And make you get up early for standups and sprint planning and all that other stuff that used to drive me crazy. I don't feel that way now. Everything's different since I realized the tech industry is volatile. Since I realized that one day in the near future, I might not have a stable backend engineering role.

            <p>
                Now I feel lucky when a PR gets approved (I used to totally dread code reviews) or when production doesn't go down during my on-call rotation and systems stay reliable. One day I might not have these problems to solve. Now I feel lucky when I see a successful deployment notification. I even like debugging race conditions. It means I'm still employed. Still a backend engineer.

                I'm a backend engineer at [Company Name] and I'm annoyingly thorough. I mean, super detail-oriented annoying. I know the most random stuff. Like how database connection pooling works. And how at scale, even a 1ms latency improvement can save thousands in infrastructure costs. Or that if you properly index your database, query performance can improve by 100x or more. I'm always dropping little facts about distributed systems. I don't realize what a geek I am for doing it, I'm just really into backend development. I think I really don't understand that not everybody is. I like to optimize code because of performance - I mostly work on APIs - because I know milliseconds matter at scale and I'm always explaining as I go. I'm told I'm a pretty good engineer. I get a lot of practice, that's for sure.
